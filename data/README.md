# Dataset Information

This project uses the **Drug Review Dataset** from Kaggle: 
ðŸ”— [Drug Review Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpanghoshal/drug-review-dataset)

## Files
- `train.csv` (raw training data from Kaggle) 
- `test.csv` (raw testing data from Kaggle) 
- `drugreviews_clean.csv` (cleaned dataset generated during preprocessing)

Note: The raw files are **too large** to upload directly to GitHub. 
To reproduce the cleaned dataset:
1. Download the raw dataset from the Kaggle link above. 
2. Run the preprocessing code in the `notebook/` folder. 
3. This will generate `drugreviews_clean.csv` locally.
